# IMDB-reviews-classificatio

We apply a classification algorithm for IMDB reviews, which is implemented using the Logistic Regression algorithm.
Each review is a vector with a value of 0 or 1, which determines whether or not a vocabulary word is present in the review.
The vocabulary includes the m most frequent words, minus n most frequent (such as: the, a, etc.), chosen by Information Gain calculation.
